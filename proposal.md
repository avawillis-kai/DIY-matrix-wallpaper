# Proposal For Final Project 

## Repository -->> https://github.com/avawillis-kai/DIY-matrix-wallpaper.git


## Description 
This is a particle rain wallpaper maker! The goal of this is to use our old particle rain code to generate a moving wallpaper and allow customization, such as color changes and shape changes to the particle rain. 

## Features
1. Pick the particle shape
2. Up to 3 customizable colors
3. Be able to download it as an MP4 to use as a computer background

## Challenges
While I'm going t be building off the particle rain that we have done previously, and I know how to build a gradient within the code, I have to figure out how to make it user friendly so that the user can navigate with set options and also download the mp4. I need to research how to create a menu for each step, how to create a color picker, and how to generate a downloadable mp4 at minimum


## Outcomes
The ideal outcome is to create a pretty wallpaper generator that produces an MP4 for the user. The minimum viable outcome is to allow the user to put inputs for colors in HEX codes, and an input for shapes, while still generating at minumum a particle rain file.

## Milestones
Week 1. Build particle rain code and cusotmizations
Week 2. Build menus for colors and shapes
Week 3. generate an MP4
Week 4. Attempt to build a pretty menu style. If not, regular text input
