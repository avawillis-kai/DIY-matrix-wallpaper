# DIY-matrix-wallpaper
## Welcome to my wallpaper generator!

# What this generator succeeds is that we are able to pick 1-4 colors for our star, pick the centermost shape, and create a wallpaper deliverable for the user to use. This is already coded to create a 1920 x 1080 resolution, perfect for any wallpaper backgrounds!

# Some key successes are that we were able to make a generator with some type of menu so the user isn't relying on the terminal space. This is nifty because there is a color picker (so the user can drag across and pick colors) or an option to input hex codes. The program will also limit you to 4 colors and a minimum of one color. I also included the fourth color for fun instead of just three, as the gradient possibilities are endless!

# Some of the challenges I came across had to do with star spacing, isolating between the star figure and the centermost particle, and creating an even loop! However, I am happy with my result!
